# One place to copy a build from, instead of a path deep inside app/build/. The
# x86_64 split is left where it is: it only ever goes to the emulator, which is
# installed to from 11-EmulRELEASE.sh and never carried anywhere by hand.
#
# The links are hard ones: the entry here is the file itself, so copying it
# elsewhere copies a build and not a dangling path, and a gradle clean leaves it
# whole. The name carries the version and the build number, so the listing says
# which build it is. Nothing is built here: 00-MakeAll.sh runs this after a
# build, and on its own it picks up a build that already exists.
